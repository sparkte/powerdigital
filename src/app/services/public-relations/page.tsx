As such, we like to establish a mix of quantitative and qualitative goals and KPIs. Data points like number of placements, impressions, number of VIPs seeded, awards won, and partnerships facilitated are things we always measure. But in PR, qualitative goals are also vital, like including certain retail partners in coverage, getting a newspaper placement on page one *above the fold* or getting your product in the hands of your favorite celebrity also has value for some brands and not for others. We'll work closely with you to make sure your goals are our goals."

These partnerships can boost brand awareness, foster authentic connections and drive engagement both online and offline through social posts, community events, word-of-mouth, etc."
